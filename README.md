# NextPy Python Course

Welcome to the repository for the NextPy Python course from campus.il! This repository contains my solutions to various mini-exercises provided throughout the course. 

## Course Overview

The NextPy course is designed to teach the fundamentals of Python programming through a series of hands-on exercises. The course covers a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:

- Functions and modules
- Exception handling
- File I/O
- Object-oriented programming
- Data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples)
- Advanced topics (decorators, generators, and more)

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories, each representing a different module or topic covered in the course. Inside each directory, you will find Python scripts (`.py` files) corresponding to the exercises for that module.
